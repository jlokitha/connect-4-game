### Game
The Connect 4 game is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid!

Players choose GREEN and BLUE discs. They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs upwards, horizontally, or diagonally. Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win.
